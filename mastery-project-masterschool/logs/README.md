# Logs Directory

This folder holds JSON log files generated by the TravelTide pipeline.
Each log file is named `<run-id>.log` and contains one JSON object per
line with structured information about the pipeline execution. Fields
include the timestamp, log level, logger name, message and any
additional context such as the run identifier. Use tools like `jq` to
filter or search log entries. Logs are created only when the pipeline
is executed without the `--dry-run` flag.
