/*
This SQL query identifies active users who have had at least 7 valid (non-cancelled) sessions since January 4th, 2023.
It then retrieves detailed session data for those users by joining related information from users, flights, and hotels.

-- Step 2: Retrieve session details for those active users

LEFT JOIN users AS usr ON ses.user_id = usr.user_id

LEFT JOIN flights AS fli ON ses.trip_id = fli.trip_id
-- Get hotel-related info based on trip_id
LEFT JOIN hotels AS htl ON ses.trip_id = htl.trip_id
-- Join with active users to filter only sessions from those users
