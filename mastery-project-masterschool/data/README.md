# Data Directory

This directory is used by the TravelTide perk recommendation pipeline
to store intermediate and final artefacts. It contains two primary
subdirectories:

| Subdirectory    | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **gold/**       | Contains the engineered user‑level feature table. Each run of the pipeline writes a file named `users_features_<run-id>.csv` into this directory. |
| **outputs/**    | Contains consumer‑facing artefacts: `perks_<run-id>.csv` maps each user to their recommended perk and `report_<run-id>.pdf` is a human‑readable summary of the distribution of perks. |

The contents of this directory are generated by the pipeline. If
`--dry-run` is used, these files will not be created. Logs are
written separately to the `logs/` directory at the project root.
